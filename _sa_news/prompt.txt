Instructions:
- Use ONLY the provided input JSON.
- Copy through the following fields exactly from the input (do not modify values):
  - source, url, tickers, title, published_at, captured_at, author_name, author_url, author_followers
- If any of those fields are missing in the input, return null for that field
  (except captured_at/url/source/title which should usually exist).
- If article_text is null or missing, rely on snippet and summary_bullets.

Sentiment definitions:
- bullish: likely positive impact
- bearish: likely negative impact
- neutral: informational or unclear impact
- mixed: meaningful pros and cons

Confidence (0–100):
- How explicit and material the impacts are.

Drivers:
- Provide 3–7 drivers.
- Each driver MUST include:
  - cluster_key
  - direction
  - impact_score
  - title
  - detail
  - evidence

cluster_key rules (IMPORTANT):
- cluster_key is a short, stable, snake_case identifier representing the underlying theme.
- Reuse the SAME cluster_key for semantically similar drivers across articles.
- Prefer broader, reusable themes over narrow or article-specific ones.
- Do NOT create near-duplicate keys with slightly different wording.
- If an existing cluster_key reasonably fits, reuse it exactly.
- Only create a new cluster_key if none of the existing ones apply.

Existing cluster_keys (reuse if applicable):
- [
  "broadband_upgrade_cycle",
  "capital_return_special_dividend",
  "customer_concentration_risk",
  "earnings_momentum",
  "portfolio_simplification_divestitures",
  "wifi_7_adoption"
]

Examples of good cluster_keys:
- hbm_demand_strength
- capex_cycle_risk
- oversupply_risk
- valuation_cyclical_peak
- regulatory_risk
- earnings_momentum
- guidance_uncertainty

impact_score rubric:
- +5 / -5: clearly material, strongly emphasized
- +3 / -3: meaningful
- +1 / -1: minor
- 0: unclear or descriptive only

key_dates:
- Include ONLY explicitly stated dates.
- Do NOT infer or guess dates.
- Horizon rules (relative to published_at; if published_at missing, use captured_at):
  - near_term: ≤ 90 days
  - mid_term: > 90 days and ≤ 18 months
  - long_term: > 18 months

read_grade (1–5):
- 5: must-read, new insights or major catalyst
- 4: very good, solid analysis or important update
- 3: decent, confirms known info
- 2: weak, low signal
- 1: skip, fluff or no insight

tags:
- 3–8 concise lowercase snake_case tags

recap:
- Max 100 words
- Neutral tone
- No recommendations
